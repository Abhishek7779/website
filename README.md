Central place for ideas and designs for MooTools Projects.

Want to help, go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/mootools/website/wiki) and add your things.

Now there is something implemented already too. To start hacking follow the steps below:

## Installation

To install everything you need to clone the repository and submodules (for the docs), install dependencies, build the documentation and run the server:

```bash
~$ git clone git://github.com/mootools/website.git
~$ cd website
~/website$ git submodule update --init
~/website$ npm install
~/website$ node build/docs.js prime
~/website$ node build/docs.js elements
~/website$ node index
```

## Run it

To run it, you can either use node directly, use forever or use supervisor.

```bash
node index
```

Now the website is running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Vagrant

If you don't want to install all node.js dependencies (and maybe later nginx),
you can use Vagrant to get the same setup.

Once that's done you're only a `vagrant up` away of running everything
automatically. The website should then be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

## Like to help?

* We need all websites for all projects, it needs to be easy, fast and done well.
* Like to work with cool techniques like node, express, jade and stylus?
* We also need great content and documentation.
* All pages and navigation need to be fixed
* Homepage needs to be transformed into html/css according to [the design](https://github.com/mootools/website/tree/master/design)
* Styling for different projects according [designs](https://github.com/mootools/website/tree/master/design)
* Adding sites for other projects: wrapup, moofx, agent
* Integrate the wrapup-webbuilder better
* Search (Lucene with node?)
* Overall polish
* So fork and send pull requests!
