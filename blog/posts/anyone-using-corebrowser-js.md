On our road to Version 1.5, we're trying to eliminate some bad practices from our code. One of the things we've just gotten rid of, is that a few last pieces of our libraries still depended on Browser UA detection. This has all been eliminated in favour of feature detection. To help us reach a decision on where to go with the `Browser` module, here's a quick survey. Reply via [@mootools](https://twitter.com/mootools) or leave a comment here.

Are you using the [Browser module](https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/blob/master/Source/Browser/Browser.js)? If so, what are you using it for?

Cheers!
