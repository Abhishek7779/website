Just a quick update to let you know we've added comments through Disqus to all Forge plugins.

If you're a plugin owner, you can subscribe by going to your plugin page and clicking 'subscribe by email' at the bottom.

Remember, if you find a bug in a plugin, you should always report it in that repository's Github Issues.

As it stands, all comments will need to be moderated before they appear, just to make sure we don't get trolled / spammed and we're really looking forward to adding the ability to comment to the other parts of the website - particularly in documentation.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/anutron">Aaron</a> for making this happen!
