**UPDATE**: Sincere thanks to all of you who actually believed this was real news! April Fools' wouldn't be as much fun without you.

The MooTools project has been around for quite some time now. We've seen a few releases, some great, some less great (1.0). We've coded tons of plug-ins, scripts, websites, applications and desktop applications using our beloved MooTools. However, the community is really starting to get tired, tired of this project name. I mean, seriously, we're really fed up with cows. We even tried to "sell" it as My Object Oriented Tools, but we all know that's a stretch, and a pretty bad one.

<!--more-->

<script type="text/javascript"><!--
document.addEvent('domready', function(){
  document.getElement('#header h1 a').setStyle('background', 'url(/assets/images/pranks/jtools.png)');
  document.getElement('#header h2').setStyle('background-image', 'url(/assets/images/pranks/jsubtitle.png)');
});
// --></script>

Therefore, I officially announce to the world that from now on MooTools will be known as *jTools*. This is the totally logical choice for our new name, since you know, the j stands for JavaScript, and well, MooTools is written in JavaScript. It's so obvious I can't really understand why everyone doesn't just prepend j into their JavaScript project name. Anyways, I hope you'll like it, as this new name is very likely to stick around pretty much forever! On another note, we are also renaming MooTools More to *jMore*, MooTools Core to *jCore* and Aaron is renaming <a href="http://www.clientcide.com">Clientcide</a> to *jCide*.

Also, we're going to remove internet explorer 6 support from in next minor version of *jTools*. I wish I could tell you more about this decision, but it's far less important than the groundbreaking name change, so I'll leave it for another day.

Cheers!
