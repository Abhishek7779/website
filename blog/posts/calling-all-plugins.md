One of the main things missing since the forums have gone into read only mode is the Your Scripts section.  We realize this and are working to complete our own plugin directory.

We're trying to assemble a comprehensive list of all our plugins.  As part of this effort, we're asking all plugin creators to send an email to plugins@mootools.net with the following information:

* Plugin Name
* Plugin URL
* Plugin Description (one line)
* Plugin author name and link (if applicable)

At this time, we're only interested in collecting data on plugins which are compatible with the 1.2 release.

This is a temporary measure until we get a more interactive system in place.
