<p>The MooTools Forge, our plugins repository, is officially 7 days old. What have we accomplished in this short period of time?</p>

<h3>The Forge in Numbers</h3>

<p>In this first week:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><strong>20,000</strong> different people have visited the forge</p></li>
	<li><p>Together, they visited <strong>93,000</strong> pages</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>65</strong> projects were created</p></li>
	<li><p>There's been over <strong>4000</strong> downloads</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>300</strong> developers signed up</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>10%</strong> contributed plugins</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Milestones</h3>

<ul>
	<li><p>We were featured in the <a href="http://github.com/blog/566-github-rebase-32">GitHub Rebase</a></p></li>
	<li><p>We got a lot of positive <a href="http://mooforge.uservoice.com/">feedback</a> and useful suggestions</p></li>
	<li><p>We pushed some visual enhancements and small features and fixes, and will continue to do so iteratively.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally want to thank everyone who has joined and shared their efforts, and encourage everyone else to do the same. </p>

<p>Happy Mooing!</p>
