Hello everyone,

I'm really excited and pleased to announce that my presentation "MooTools as a General Purpose Application Framework" which I delivered at the <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> is now available on YouTube.

If you are not able to watch the HD-Version you can download the slides <a href="http://cpojer.net/Talks/MooToolsFOSDEM.pdf">here</a>.

Thanks again to the FOSDEM team for inviting me and for giving us such a big platform to present the MooTools project. If I could name one thing that I miss already about Brussels I would certainly say the waffles...

If you enjoyed this presentation and you want me or another developer from the MooTools Core Team to present at your conference feel free to <a href="/developers">contact us</a>.
