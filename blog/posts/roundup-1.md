The foundation of every great open source project is its community.  The MooTools Team creates the base framework code but it's all of you that take the framework and build outstanding plugins.  Here are some great plugins that have been released recently.

<h3>Slideshow 2</h3>

Slideshow 2 by Aeron Glemann is an outstanding photo / slideshow plugin that offers a plethora of options and features -- many more than you'd find with the average slideshow or lightbox.  Slideshow 2 features Robert Penner easing transitions, photo delays, duration settings, the ability to make Slideshow 2 a lightbox, and an on-photo control panel.

Fancy Upload 3 is the newest iteration of Harlad Kirschner's popular Flash/MooTools upload tool.  Fancy Upload 3 features file-specific options, an additional IFrame-based uploader, Flash 9 and 10 compatibility, and the same base features that made Fancy Upload a must-have plugin.
