So we've been running the challenges for a month now and are excited by the conversation and participation we've seen surrounding them. We just wanted to take this opportunity to say thanks! :)etter, have fixed an issue and want to help us by providing a fix.

### How to get help

Your first ports of call, should you want help, should be either our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/mootools-users) or our [IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mootools). 

(got distracted - will finish soon) a bit easier to use.</p>

<h3>MooPix</h3>
<p>MooPix is not only a MooTools slideshow function but a method for accessing your public Flickr photos.  Though no server side scripting is required, MooPix remains very small.</p>
