Today I found a nice article on [coderseye.com](http://coderseye.com/2007/mootools-beats-jquery-and-ext-for-air.html):

>I spent a half hour tinkering around in Aptana, downloading MooTools 1.1, and setting up a few tests. The result is extremely pleasing. Not only is MooTools way better and easier to use than I remember, but it works out of the box with AIR.

That's **Very** nice to know!

I personally haven't yet tried MooTools in AIR extensively (i only did a few basic tests) but I'm definitely looking forward to creating something in the very near future. Maybe a downloader app? We'll see!
